## Description 
 This Python-based, object-oriented project uses an image segmentation model, https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything, to mask images and the python package PIL to edit images. It provides a user-friendly interface for cropping and editing several different features of images, as well as for masking any number of objects within these images using different combinations of input parameters.
 ## Folders
 The example masking folder contains 3 sets of example images and code to mask these images. 

The Jupyter Notebook folder contains the jupyter notebook which documents in detail how to use the code.

The source code folder contains all python files and functions necessary to edit and mask images.

The requirements.txt contains all required python packages.
