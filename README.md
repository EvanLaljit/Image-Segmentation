# Image Segmentation
## Description 
 This project uses an image segmentation model, https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything, to mask images and the python package PIL to edit images. It provides a user-friendly interface for cropping and editing several different features of images, as well as for masking any number of objects within these images using different combinations of input parameters.
